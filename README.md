# Serverless-functions-for-in-memory-DB
 In order to study serverless functions we select Google Cloud Functions as a serverless framework, Redis, a popular key-value store, as a database system, and the Yahoo Cloud Serving Benchmark (YCSB), as a workload. We implement a serverless YCSB client for Redis, studying the role of clients and configurations in influencing the performance of the serverless functions with respect to a general Redis YCSB client. Among our findings, from evaluating on a desktop computer and on Google Cloud, we find that serverless functions with local cloud emulators can match and outperform the throughput of traditional deployments for data ingestion into Redis; while read operations are still better served without serverless processing. We can also report that, counter-intuitively, when migrating to a cloud provider with basic settings, serverless processing seems to lose its competitive edge for data loading.
